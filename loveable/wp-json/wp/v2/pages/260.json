According to an ancient legend, Bodhidarma was the first man to create tea. Bodhidarma was a Buddhist monk and Zen master who lived during the 5th and 6th century. His wish was to meditate in front of a wall for 9 years. To prevent himself from falling asleep at night he would pluck out his eyebrows. As his hairs fell to the ground they grew into the first tea bushes. From then on it became a ritual in Buddhism to drink tea when meditating, to stay awake and alert.<\/p>\n<p>Whether its to awaken and stay alert or for myriad other positive ends, we trust you will love drinking our beautiful teas as much as we love making them for you.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n\t<div id=\"gap-357756180\" class=\"gap-element clearfix\" style=\"display:block; height:auto;\">\n\t\t\n<style>\n#gap-357756180 {\n  padding-top: 50px;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>about us<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":27,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":26,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"page-blank.php","meta":{"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-260","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Unique Therapeutic Delicious Organic Herbal Tea | Bodhi Organic Tea<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Dedicated to blending beautiful, unique, organic herbal tea.
